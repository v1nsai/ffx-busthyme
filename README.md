# FFX-BusThyme

A basic webapp that shows routes and live vehicle locations for Fairfax Connector busses.  This started as an investigation into the reason most popular transit apps do not show live location for many routes, including ones I frequently use, but I decided to put together a simple app to solve the problem.  Late or early busses aren't a problem when you can see where they are and leave earlier or later.

At the moment it works for my basic needs, but it looks like a frontend app written by a backend dev.  I may add more features to it, or I may never write in javascript again.
